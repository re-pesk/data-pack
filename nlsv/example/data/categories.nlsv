ajax
Ajax
The jQuery library has a full suite of Ajax capabilities. The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh.
http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/

ajax.global-ajax-event-handlers
Global Ajax Event Handlers
These methods register handlers to be called when certain events, such as initialization or completion, take place for any Ajax request on the page. The global events are fired on each Ajax request if the `global` property in [jQuery.ajaxSetup()](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/) is `true`, which it is by default. *Note: Global events are never fired for cross-domain script or JSONP requests, regardless of the value of global.*

ajax.helper-functions
Helper Functions
These functions assist with common idioms encountered when performing Ajax tasks.
http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/helper-functions/

ajax.low-level-interface
Low-Level Interface
These methods can be used to make arbitrary Ajax requests.
http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/low-level-interface/

ajax.shorthand-methods
Shorthand Methods
These methods perform the more common types of Ajax requests in less code.

attributes
Attributes
These methods get and set DOM attributes of elements.

callbacks-object
Callbacks Object
The `jQuery.Callbacks()` function, introduced in version 1.7, returns a multi-purpose object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. It supports adding, removing, firing, and disabling callbacks.

data

http://api.jquery.com/category/data/

deferred-object
Deferred Object
The Deferred object, introduced in jQuery 1.5, is a chainable utility object created by calling the [jQuery.Deferred()](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/) method. It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.\nThe Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.

manipulation
Manipulation
All of the methods in this section manipulate the DOM in some manner. A few of them simply change one of the attributes of an element (also listed in the [Attributes category](https://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/)), while others set an element's style properties (also listed in the [CSS category](https://api.jquery.com/category/css/)). Still others modify entire elements (or groups of elements) themselves—inserting, copying, removing, and so on. All of these methods are referred to as "setters," as they change the values of properties.\nA few of these methods — such as `.attr()`, `.html()`, and `.val()` — also act as "getters," retrieving information from DOM elements for later use.
http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/

manipulation.class-attribute

selectors
Selectors
Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document.\nTo use any of the meta-characters ( such as ``!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~`` ) as a literal part of a name, it must be escaped with with two backslashes: ``\\``. For example, an element with ``id="foo.bar"``, can use the selector ``$("#foo\\.bar")``. The W3C CSS specification contains the [complete set of rules regarding valid CSS selectors](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier). Also useful is the blog entry by Mathias Bynens on [CSS character escape sequences for identifiers](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes).
http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

selectors.attribute
Attribute
The CSS specification allows elements to be identified by their attributes. While not supported by some older browsers for the purpose of styling documents, jQuery allows you to employ them regardless of the browser being used.
http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/

selectors.basic
Basic
The following selectors are based on the Cascading Style Sheet 1 specification, as outlined by the W3C. For more information about the specifications, visit <https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#specs>.

selectors.jquery-extensions
jQuery Extensions
Query has extended the CSS3 selectors with the following selectors. Because these selectors are jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using them cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM `querySelectorAll()` method. To achieve the best performance when using these selectors, first select some elements using a pure CSS selector, then use [.filter()](https://api.jquery.com/filter/).
